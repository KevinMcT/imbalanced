- Who are we
- What we're about
- How can you join?! - (TLDR [Apply](https://forms.gle/L4999y2iGFdHx6Sf9))

### Imbalanced (Who are we)

We're a small core of lads which used to play together back in the good old days. 
Back then we were all young lads without a care in the world, however now we're all working steady
jobs, wifes/girfriends and kids. But we found are way back to this old gem and decided we'ed give
the old raiding a go again.

We used to be quite "hardcore" raiders raiding more or less every day however, this time around
we're setting out sights on a bit more casual progression.

This is however up for debate depending on the overall feeling inside the guild.
If we have members for more then the currently planned 3(?) raids, we might set up more.

### What we're about

Looking to start a "casual" raiding guild aiming to clear the content as its release.
