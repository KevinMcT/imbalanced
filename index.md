- How can you join?! - (TLDR [Apply](https://forms.gle/L4999y2iGFdHx6Sf9))

## Imbalanced (Who are we)

The core consists of lads which used to play together back in the good old days. 
Back then we were all young lads without a care in the world, however now we're all working steady
jobs, wifes/girfriends and kids. But we found are way back to this old gem and decided we'ed give
the old raiding a go again.

## What we're about

Most of us used to be quite "hardcore" raiders raiding more or less every day however, this time around
we're setting out sights on a bit more casual progression. And with that said, we hope that we can
find some like minded people to share the nostalgia with as we clear out the different raids when they're
released.

### Raid Times
Currently planned raid times are:
* Sunday: 19.30 - 23.30
* Wednesday: 19.30 - 23.30

### Loot distribution

We're using a Loot council consisting of the class leaders.
